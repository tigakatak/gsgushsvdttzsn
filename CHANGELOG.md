# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Battery optimization exemption**: a new button in Settings → Power opens the system dialog to exclude RedTerm from battery optimization, so long heavy tasks (compilations, AI agents like opencode) are not throttled or killed in the background.
- **Wi-Fi lock**: while the terminal wake lock is held, the app now also keeps the Wi-Fi radio awake, so network-dependent programs keep their connection when the screen is off.

### Changed

- **Performance**: distro disk usage is no longer scanned on the UI thread — home, terminal, settings and widget now show sizes from a cache (60 s TTL) computed on a background thread, removing multi-second UI freezes when opening screens with large rootfs.
- **Terminal environment**: proot sessions now export `TERM=xterm-256color`, `LANG`/`LC_ALL=C.UTF-8` and `TZ` (device timezone) before the guest shell starts, improving compatibility with heavy TUI programs (opencode, node, go binaries) that expect a proper terminal, UTF-8 locale and timezone.

## [v1.0.3]

### Changed

- **Extra keys**: swapped the positions of the left and right arrow triangles in the default second key row (`◀ ▼ ▶` instead of `▶ ▼ ◀`); Reset in Settings uses the new order too.
- Settings page shows version v1.0.3.

### Fixed

- **Shared storage in distros**: the terminal's proot session now binds `/sdcard`, `/storage` and `/mnt` into the distro, so `/storage/emulated/0` files are visible and usable inside every distro.
- **All files access**: the All files access request moved back to the terminal screen (where it was in earlier builds) instead of the welcome screen, where it could be skipped — the terminal re-asks until it is granted and shows a toast explaining why it is needed.

## [v1.0.2]

### Added

- **Setup permissions**: storage and notification permissions are now requested on the welcome screen during setup instead of when the terminal opens.
- **Custom bash templates**: create your own named `.bashrc` templates in Settings → Bashrc templates, then edit or delete them; deleting a template resets any distro using it back to its original `.bashrc`.
- **Custom fonts**: import your own `.ttf`/`.otf` fonts in Settings — one at a time or several at once from the storage picker — then select them from the font dropdown or the terminal's Fonts menu; custom fonts can be renamed and removed, and names default to the file name without the extension.
- **Modern back button**: the back control is now a round, theme-aware chip; it also appears on the main page and in Settings, with the same style applied in the terminal, file browser and bash templates screens.

### Changed

- **Theme sync**: changing the theme in Settings or from the terminal's Theme menu now broadcasts the change, so the main page and every other screen repaint immediately with the selected theme.
- The terminal's Fonts menu lists imported custom fonts and refreshes every time the menu opens.
- Settings page shows version v1.0.2.
- Settings label renamed to **Bashrc templates**.
- **Toolchain**: Gradle 8.13 → 8.14.5, Kotlin 2.3.0 → 2.4.10, `compileSdk` 35 → 36; dependency updates across androidx (lifecycle 2.8.7 → 2.11.0, activity 1.9.3 → 1.13.0, material 1.12.0 → 1.14.0, constraintlayout 2.2.0 → 2.2.2, appcompat, preference, viewpager2), commons-compress 1.27.1 → 1.28.0 and xz 1.10 → 1.12; `core-ktx` pinned at 1.18.0 (1.19.0 requires AGP 9.1 and compileSdk 37).
- GitHub Actions updated: `setup-android` v3 → v4, `setup-java` v4 → v5.6.0, `gradle/actions/wrapper-validation` v3 → v6.

### Fixed

- **Android 7.0/7.1 support**: the app no longer crashes on API 24–25 at startup (`NotificationChannel` is now only created on Android 8+), and distro extraction/repair no longer calls `java.nio.file` (API 26) or `Process#destroyForcibly` (API 26) unguarded — symlinks are created with `Os.symlink` (API 21+), so first-time setup and busybox repair work on Android 7+.
- CI: official Gradle wrapper jar (checksum validation was failing), compileSdk 36 for the new androidx versions, lint set to non-fatal, docs updated with the current build requirements.

## [v1.0.1]

### Added

- **Bash templates**: pick from eight built-in `.bashrc` templates (Stock, Powerline, Minimal, DevOps, Hacker, Starship, Matrix, Retro CRT) in Settings → Bash templates; applied per-distro, auto-applies directly when only one distro is installed, one template can be applied to multiple distros at once, and each distro can be reset to its original `.bashrc`. The original `.bashrc` is backed up before the first overwrite.
- **Bell/command feedback**: terminal rings (haptic vibration) on BEL, and `PROMPT_COMMAND` rings the bell when a command exits with a non-zero status.
- **Export terminal output**: Copy, Paste and Export buttons in the sessions drawer; exported transcripts are saved to `/sdcard/RedTerm/exports/`.
- **Dynamic session title**: toolbar now shows `distro › /cwd`, updated live while a session runs.
- **Per-distro management**: MainActivity cards now show rootfs size and a long-press menu with Launch / Files / Backup now / Remove.
- **Custom extra keys**: two editable key rows in Settings (space-separated tokens: ESC, TAB, CTRL, ALT, HOME, END, UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, INS, DEL, BACKSPACE, MENU, `&&` — anything else is typed as text).
- **Open terminal here**: FileBrowser menu action launches a terminal session rooted at the current directory.
- **App lock**: optional 4-8 digit PIN required when opening the app.
- **Settings backup**: Import Config button added next to Export Config (`RedTerm_config.json`).
- **Keep screen on**: the wake lock toggle now also keeps the screen lit while the terminal is open.
- **Widget session count**: widget shows the number of active sessions and a contextual tap hint; a widget config screen lets you pick which distro the widget launches.
- **Split view**: Split button in the quick panel shows two terminal panes side-by-side; extra keys route to the focused pane; split mode collapses automatically when a session exits.
- **FileBrowser search**: search files by name in the current directory with the option to descend into found folders.
- **Terminal find**: highlight all matches in the scrollback, jump and cycle between them.
- **Bundled fonts**: real font files (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Source Code Pro, Ubuntu Mono, Droid Sans Mono, Noto Sans Mono, Cascadia Code) shipped in assets and loaded from there.
- **Files browser**: browse the distro rootfs.
- **Home-screen widget**: quick launch a distro from the launcher.
- **Night mode**: automatic switching to AMOLED between 6 PM and 6 AM (toggle in Settings).
- **Session persistence**: sessions survive activity restarts and are resumed on reopen.
- **Distro backup/restore**: improved multi-select backup with progress, restore validation, and backups under `/sdcard/RedTerm/`.
- **CPU indicator**: live CPU usage shown in the service notification.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: F1-F12 keys emit the proper escape sequences.
- **Output coalescing**: terminal redraws batched via Choreographer for smoother rendering.
- **Exit-status indicator**: a red "✗ Last command failed" strip flashes for a few seconds when a command exits with a non-zero status (tap it to dismiss); complements the existing failure bell.
- **Tap links and paths**: tapping a URL or a file path in the terminal pops up actions to open it in the browser / file browser or copy it.
- **Quick Settings tile**: a tile that launches the last-used distro straight from the quick settings shade.
- **Home-screen shortcut**: distro menu gains "Home shortcut" to pin a launcher shortcut for that distro.
- **Dynamic (Material You) theme**: new "Dynamic" theme option (Android 12+) that follows the system wallpaper palette, applied to both the app and the terminal colors.

### Changed

- Session persistence is now process-wide; sessions survive activity restarts and are resumed on reopen.
- Session creation, switch and finish flows share a single handler (also used by split view).
- Extra keys are rendered from preferences instead of a hardcoded list.
- Widget configurable per instance via a configuration activity.
- Improved session drawer controls.
- Fonts loaded from app assets instead of the system font directory.
- Base tarballs kept in app files after install so distro reset runs offline; removed on uninstall.
- Shell configs (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.startup`) only written when missing, so user customizations are never overwritten.
- Terminal bell toggle in Settings (vibration on BEL / failed commands).
- "Quick settings" and "Split view" entries in the terminal's three-dots menu, so both are discoverable without tapping the top edge of the screen.
- Dynamic theme added to the Settings theme picker and the terminal's Theme menu.
- Split view: each pane now has its own terminal client (live output in both), tapping a pane selects that session (title, drawer highlight, extra keys, CTRL/ALT target it), and the keyboard is no longer force-restarted when switching panes (no more freeze).

### Fixed

- Rootfs `.startup` script now only marks first-time setup complete when package installation succeeds, falling back to a repair shell instead of failing silently.
- CPU indicator integer-division bug that always showed 0%.
- Terminal now renders custom fonts through a shared helper so split panes use the same font.
- Layout-params type mismatch in FileBrowser search bar (LinearLayout params on a LinearLayout child).
- Several Kotlin type-inference issues around key actions.
- Main navigation mix-up where the home button launched Settings instead of Main.
- Terminal activity buttons not respecting theme changes.
- Bash prompt errors (`=0: command not found`, `[: -ne: unary operator expected`) from a fragile `PROMPT_COMMAND`; replaced with a simple `[ $? -eq 0 ] || printf "\a"`.
- Distro reset (long-press card) now restores a fresh state offline: the rootfs is re-extracted from the cached base tarball, wiping installed packages, caches and shell configs; the next launch runs first-time setup again.
- Distro removal now fully removes the distro: rootfs, cached tarball and registry entry are deleted, and any running sessions for that distro are killed, so a later reinstall starts completely fresh.
